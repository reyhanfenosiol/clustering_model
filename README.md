# Clustering Model Analysis for Aid Distribution in a Country Based on Social, Economic, and Health Factors

Proposed Research:
This study aims to,
- Develop a clustering model to analyze and understand the characteristics of each country group formed based on social, economic, and health factors.
- Create visual representations of the relationships among countries using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) to reveal underlying patterns.
- Assist NGO executives (CEOs) and decision-makers in identifying priority countries for aid distribution based on clustering analysis and MDS results

## What is our conclusion?

1. The K-Means clustering model has identified four distinct clusters, each representing different characteristics based on social, economic, and health factors. Cluster 1, consisting of 34 countries, represents nations with high levels of welfare, good healthcare systems, and stable economies. Cluster 2, with 87 countries, includes nations that engage in high international trade activity but experience lower levels of societal welfare. Cluster 3, comprising 43 countries, consists of nations struggling with public health issues and poverty challenges. Lastly, Cluster 4, which contains only 3 countries, represents nations that are highly engaged in international trade and have a high life expectancy but face challenges related to low birth rates. These clustering results provide valuable insights into the economic, social, and health disparities among countries, enabling better targeted aid distribution strategies.

2. The results of clustering with Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) refine and clarify the proximity relationships between the grouped countries. In Cluster 4, which initially consisted of Luxembourg, Malta, and Singapore, the MDS clustering results have added Ireland and Seychelles to this group, indicating a stronger similarity in their characteristics. Meanwhile, the composition of countries in other clusters remains largely unchanged, reaffirming the consistency of the clustering model. This enhancement through MDS provides a more precise visualization of country groupings, improving the interpretability of the clustering results for better-informed decision-making.

3. NGO CEOs can prioritize aid distribution by focusing first on countries in Cluster 3, as these nations face severe public health issues and high poverty levels, making them the most critical recipients of assistance. Next, priority can be given to countries in Cluster 2, where societal welfare levels remain below the average of developed nations, despite their high engagement in international trade. Following these, aid efforts can extend to Cluster 4 and Cluster 1, which, while relatively more stable, may still have specific challenges that require support. This strategic prioritization ensures that resources are allocated effectively, addressing the most urgent humanitarian needs first.
